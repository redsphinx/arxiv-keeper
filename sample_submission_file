Title: ASHACL: Alternative Shapes Constraint Language
Authors: Peter F. Patel-Schneider
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 17 pages
\\
  ASHACL, a variant of the W3C Shapes Constraint Language, is designed to
determine whether an RDF graph meets some conditions. These conditions are
grouped into shapes, which validate whether particular RDF terms each meet the
constraints of the shape. Shapes are themselves expressed as RDF triples in an
RDF graph, called a shapes graph.

Title: Extracting Lifted Mutual Exclusion Invariants from Temporal Planning
  Domains
Authors: Sara Bernardini, Fabio Fagnani, David E. Smith
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We present a technique for automatically extracting mutual exclusion
invariants from temporal planning instances. It first identifies a set of
invariant templates by inspecting the lifted representation of the domain and
then checks these templates against properties that assure invariance. Our
technique builds on other approaches to invariant synthesis presented in the
literature, but departs from their limited focus on instantaneous actions by
addressing temporal domains. To deal with time, we formulate invariance
conditions that account for the entire structure of the actions and the
possible concurrent interactions between them. As a result, we construct a
significantly more comprehensive technique than previous methods, which is able
to find not only invariants for temporal domains, but also a broader set of
invariants for non-temporal domains. The experimental results reported in this
paper provide evidence that identifying a broader set of invariants results in
the generation of fewer multi-valued state variables with larger domains. We
show that, in turn, this reduction in the number of variables reflects
positively on the performance of a number of temporal planners that use a
variable/value representation by significantly reducing their running time.

Title: Development of JavaScript-based deep learning platform and application
  to distributed training
Authors: Masatoshi Hidaka, Ken Miura and Tatsuya Harada
Categories: cs.CV cs.DC
Comments: Workshop paper for ICLR2017
\\
  Deep learning is increasingly attracting attention for processing big data.
Existing frameworks for deep learning must be set up to specialized computer
systems. Gaining sufficient computing resources therefore entails high costs of
deployment and maintenance. In this work, we implement a matrix library and
deep learning framework that uses JavaScript. It can run on web browsers
operating on ordinary personal computers and smartphones. Using JavaScript,
deep learning can be accomplished in widely diverse environments without the
necessity for software installation. Using GPGPU from WebCL framework, our
framework can train large scale convolutional neural networks such as VGGNet
and ResNet. In the experiments, we demonstrate their practicality by training
VGGNet in a distributed manner using web browsers as the client.

Title: A New Point-set Registration Algorithm for Fingerprint Matching
Authors: A. Pasha Hosseinbor, Renat Zhdanov, Alexander Ushveridze
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Point pattern matching, point-set registration, fingerprint, minutia
  matching, alignment
\\
  A novel minutia-based fingerprint matching algorithm is proposed that employs
iterative global alignment on two minutia sets. The matcher considers all
possible minutia pairings and iteratively aligns the two sets until the number
of minutia pairs does not exceed the maximum number of allowable one-to-one
pairings. The optimal alignment parameters are derived analytically via linear
least squares. The first alignment establishes a region of overlap between the
two minutia sets, which is then (iteratively) refined by each successive
alignment. After each alignment, minutia pairs that exhibit weak correspondence
are discarded. The process is repeated until the number of remaining pairs no
longer exceeds the maximum number of allowable one-to-one pairings. The
proposed algorithm is tested on both the FVC2000 and FVC2002 databases, and the
results indicate that the proposed matcher is both effective and efficient for
fingerprint authentication; it is fast and does not utilize any computationally
expensive mathematical functions (e.g. trigonometric, exponential). In addition
to the proposed matcher, another contribution of the paper is the analytical
derivation of the least squares solution for the optimal alignment parameters
for two point-sets lacking exact correspondence.

Title: Hashing in the Zero Shot Framework via Domain Adaptation
Authors: Shubham Pachori, Ameya Deshpande, Shanmuganathan Raman
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Techniques to learn hash codes which can store and retrieve large dimensional
multimedia data efficiently have attracted broad research interests in the
recent years. With rapid explosion of newly emerged concepts and online data,
existing supervised hashing algorithms suffer from the problem of scarcity of
ground truth annotations due to the high cost of obtaining manual annotations.
Therefore, we propose an algorithm to learn a hash function from training
images belonging to seen classes which can efficiently encode images of unseen
classes to binary codes. Specifically, we project the image features from
visual space and semantic features from semantic space into a common Hamming
subspace. Earlier works to generate hash codes have tried to relax the discrete
constraints on hash codes and solve the continuous optimization problem.
However, it often leads to quantization errors. In this work, we use the
max-margin classifier to learn an efficient hash function. To address the
concern of domain-shift which may arise due to the introduction of new classes,
we also introduce an unsupervised domain adaptation model in the proposed
hashing framework. Results on the three image datasets show the advantage of
using domain adaptation in learning a high-quality hash function and
superiority of our method for the task of image retrieval performance as
compared to several state-of-the-art hashing methods.

Title: Image Reconstruction using Matched Wavelet Estimated from Data Sensed
  Compressively using Partial Canonical Identity Matrix
Authors: Naushad Ansari, Anubha Gupta
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This paper proposes a joint framework wherein lifting-based, separable,
image-matched wavelets are estimated from compressively sensed (CS) images and
used for the reconstruction of the same. Matched wavelet can be easily designed
if full image is available. Also matched wavelet may provide better
reconstruction results in CS application compared to standard wavelet
sparsifying basis. Since in CS application, we have compressively sensed image
instead of full image, existing methods of designing matched wavelet cannot be
used. Thus, we propose a joint framework that estimates matched wavelet from
the compressively sensed images and also reconstructs full images. This paper
has three significant contributions. First, lifting-based, image-matched
separable wavelet is designed from compressively sensed images and is also used
to reconstruct the same. Second, a simple sensing matrix is employed to sample
data at sub-Nyquist rate such that sensing and reconstruction time is reduced
considerably without any noticeable degradation in the reconstruction
performance. Third, a new multi-level L-Pyramid wavelet decomposition strategy
is provided for separable wavelet implementation on images that leads to
improved reconstruction performance. Compared to CS-based reconstruction using
standard wavelets with Gaussian sensing matrix and with existing wavelet
decomposition strategy, the proposed methodology provides faster and better
image reconstruction in compressive sensing application.

Title: Face Aging With Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Grigory Antipov, Moez Baccouche, Jean-Luc Dugelay
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ICIP 2017
\\
  It has been recently shown that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can
produce synthetic images of exceptional visual fidelity. In this work, we
propose the GAN-based method for automatic face aging. Contrary to previous
works employing GANs for altering of facial attributes, we make a particular
emphasize on preserving the original person's identity in the aged version of
his/her face. To this end, we introduce a novel approach for
"Identity-Preserving" optimization of GAN's latent vectors. The objective
evaluation of the resulting aged and rejuvenated face images by the
state-of-the-art face recognition and age estimation solutions demonstrate the
high potential of the proposed method.

Title: Tracking using Numerous Anchor points
Authors: Tanushri Chakravorty, Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau, Eric Granger
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, an online adaptive model-free tracker is proposed to track
single objects in video sequences to deal with real-world tracking challenges
like low-resolution, object deformation, occlusion and motion blur. The novelty
lies in the construction of a strong appearance model that captures features
from the initialized bounding box and then are assembled into anchor-point
features. These features memorize the global pattern of the object and have an
internal star graph-like structure. These features are unique and flexible and
helps tracking generic and deformable objects with no limitation on specific
objects. In addition, the relevance of each feature is evaluated online using
short-term consistency and long-term consistency. These parameters are adapted
to retain consistent features that vote for the object location and that deal
with outliers for long-term tracking scenarios. Additionally, voting in a
Gaussian manner helps in tackling inherent noise of the tracking system and in
accurate object localization. Furthermore, the proposed tracker uses pairwise
distance measure to cope with scale variations and combines pixel-level binary
features and global weighted color features for model update. Finally,
experimental results on a visual tracking benchmark dataset are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed tracker.

  We study the {\em maximum duo-preservation string mapping} ({\sc Max-Duo})
problem, which is the complement of the well studied {\em minimum common string
partition} ({\sc MCSP}) problem. Both problems have applications in many fields
including text compression and bioinformatics. Motivated by an earlier local
search algorithm, we present an improved approximation and show that its
performance ratio is no greater than ${35}/{12} < 2.917$. This beats the
current best $3.25$-approximation for {\sc Max-Duo}. The performance analysis
of our algorithm is done through a complex yet interesting amortization. Two
lower bounds on the locality gap of our algorithm are also provided.

Title: Towards A Unified View of Linear Structure on Graph Classes
Authors: Pierre Charbit, Michel Habib, Lalla Mouatadid, Reza Naserasr
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  Graph searching, a mechanism to traverse a graph in a spe- cific manner, is a
powerful tool that has led to a number of elegant algo- rithms. This paper
focuses on lexicographic breadth first search (LexBFS) (a variant of BFS)
introduced in [8] to recognize chordal graphs. Since then, there has been a
number of elegant LexBFS based, often multi-sweep, algorithms. These are
algorithms that compute a sequence of LexBFS orderings {\sigma}1 , . . . ,
{\sigma}k , and use {\sigma}i to break ties when computing {\sigma}i+1 . The
tie-breaking rule is often referred to as a + rule, and the graph search as
LexBFS+ . We write LexBFS+ (G, {\sigma}i ) = {\sigma}i+1 . In this paper, we
prove that LexBFS converges for a number of graph families, including interval
graphs, cobipartite graphs, trees, and domino-free cocomparability graphs. In
particular, we prove a fixed point theorem for LexBFS that shows the existence
of two orderings {\sigma} and {\pi} where LexBFS+ (G, {\sigma}) = {\pi} and
LexBFS+ (G, {\pi}) = {\sigma}. A consequence of this result, in particular, is
the simplest algorithm to compute a transitive orientation for these graph
classes, as well as providing a unified view of the linear structure seen on
various graph families. In addition to this algorithmic consequence, we provide
fixed point theorems for proper interval, interval, cobipartite, and
domino-free cocomparability graphs, as well as trees. These are the first
non-trivial results of this kind.

Title: A General Framework for Evaluating Callout Mechanisms in Repeated
  Auctions
Authors: Hossein Azari, William D. Heavlin, Hoda Heidari, Max Lin, and Sonia
  Todorova
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  Motivated by online display ad exchanges, we study a setting in which an
exchange repeatedly interacts with bidders who have quota, making decisions
about which subsets of bidders are called to participate in ad-slot-specific
auctions. A bidder with quota cannot respond to more than a certain number of
calls per second. In practice, random throttling is the principal solution by
which these constraints are enforced. Given the repeated nature of the
interaction with its bidders, the exchange has access to data containing
information about each bidder's segments of interest. This information can be
utilized to design smarter callout mechanisms --- with the potential of
improving the exchange's long-term revenue. In this work, we present a general
framework for evaluating and comparing the performance of various callout
mechanisms using historical auction data only. To measure the impact of a
callout mechanism on long-term revenue, we propose a strategic model that
captures the repeated interaction between the exchange and bidders. Our model
leads us to two metrics for performance: immediate revenue impact and social
welfare. Next we present an empirical framework for estimating these two
metrics from historical data. For the baseline to compare against, we consider
random throttling, as well as a greedy algorithm with certain theoretical
guarantees. We propose several natural callout mechanisms and investigate them
through our framework on both synthetic and real auction data. We characterize
the conditions under which each heuristic performs well and show that, in
addition to being computationally faster, in practice our heuristics
consistently and significantly outperform the baselines.

  Machine learning has been gaining traction in recent years to meet the demand
for tools that can efficiently analyze and make sense of the ever-growing
databases of biomedical data in health care systems around the world. However,
effectively using machine learning methods requires considerable domain
expertise, which can be a barrier of entry for bioinformaticians new to
computational data science methods. Therefore, off-the-shelf tools that make
machine learning more accessible can prove invaluable for bioinformaticians. To
this end, we have developed an open source pipeline optimization tool
(TPOT-MDR) that uses genetic programming to automatically design machine
learning pipelines for bioinformatics studies. In TPOT-MDR, we implement
Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) as a feature construction method for
modeling higher-order feature interactions, and combine it with a new expert
knowledge-guided feature selector for large biomedical data sets. We
demonstrate TPOT-MDR's capabilities using a combination of simulated and real
world data sets from human genetics and find that TPOT-MDR significantly
outperforms modern machine learning methods such as logistic regression and
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We further analyze the best pipeline
discovered by TPOT-MDR for a real world problem and highlight TPOT-MDR's
ability to produce a high-accuracy solution that is also easily interpretable.

  This paper presents a multi-layer perceptron model for the estimation of
classrooms number of occupants from sensed indoor environmental data-relative
humidity, air temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration. The modelling
datasets were collected from two classrooms in the Secondary School of Pombal,
Portugal. The number of occupants and occupation periods were obtained from
class attendance reports. However, post-class occupancy was unknown and the
developed model is used to reconstruct the classrooms occupancy by filling the
unreported periods. Different model structure and environment variables
combination were tested. The model with best accuracy had as input vector 10
variables of five averaged time intervals of relative humidity and carbon
dioxide concentration. The model presented a mean square error of 1.99,
coefficient of determination of 0.96 with a significance of p-value < 0.001,
and a mean absolute error of 1 occupant. These results show promising
estimation capabilities in uncertain indoor environment conditions.

  Controllers for autonomous robotic systems can be specified using state
machines. However, these are typically developed in an ad hoc manner without
formal semantics, which makes it difficult to analyse the controller.
Simulations are often used during the development, but a rigorous connection
between the designed controller and the implementation is often overlooked.
This paper presents a state-machine based notation, RoboChart, together with a
tool to automatically create code from the state machines, establishing a
rigorous connection between specification and implementation. In RoboChart, a
robot's controller is specified either graphically or using a textual
description language. The controller code for simulation is automatically
generated through a direct mapping from the specification. We demonstrate our
approach using two case studies (self-organized aggregation and swarm taxis) in
swarm robotics. The simulations are presented using two different simulators
showing the general applicability of our approach.

\\
  Robots such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and autonomous surface
vehicles (ASVs) have been used for sensing and monitoring aquatic environments
such as oceans and lakes. Environmental sampling is a challenging task because
the environmental attributes to be observed can vary both spatially and
temporally, and the target environment is usually a large and continuous domain
whereas the sampling data is typically sparse and limited. The challenges
require that the sampling method must be informative and efficient enough to
catch up with the environmental dynamics. In this paper we present a planning
and learning method that enables a sampling robot to perform persistent
monitoring tasks by learning and refining a spatiotemporal environmental model.
Our environmental sampling framework consists of two components: to maximize
the information collected, we propose an informative planning component that
efficiently generates sampling waypoints that contain the maximal information;
To alleviate the computational bottleneck caused by large-scale data
accumulated, we develop a component based on a sparse Gaussian Process whose
hyperparameters are learned online by taking advantage of only a subset of data
that provides the greatest contribution. We validate our method with both
simulations running on real ocean data and field trials with an ASV in a lake
environment. Our experiments show that the proposed framework is both accurate
and efficient in learning the spatiotemporal environmental model

Categories: cs.RO math.DS
Comments: 8 pages, 11 figures
\\
  In this study, a new position control scheme for the tendon-sheath mechanism
(TSM) which is used in flexible medical devices is presented. TSM is widely
used in dexterous robotic applications because it can flexibly work in limited
space, in constrained environments, and provides efficient power transmission
from the external actuator to the distal joint. However, nonlinearities from
friction and backlash hysteresis between the tendon and the sheath pose
challenges in achieving precise position controls of the end effector. Previous
studies on the TSM only address the control problem under the assumptions of
known tendon-sheath configuration and known model parameters of the backlash
hysteresis nonlinearity. These approaches can have adverse impact and
limitations on the overall system performances and practical implementation.
This paper presents a new approach to model and control the TSM-driven flexible
robotic systems. The designed controller does not require exact knowledge of
nonlinear friction and backlash hysteresis parameters, only their bounds are
online estimated. Simulation and experimental validation results show that the
proposed control scheme can significantly improve the tracking performances
without the presence of the exact knowledge of the model parameters and the
sheath configuration.

the global asymptotically stable in probability can be achieved for the
closed-loop system. The simulation results are presented to demonstrate the

poles are considered; multi-repeated zeros and poles are also applicable. To
obtain the optimal performance, the two-parameter controller is adopted. The
theoretical results show that the optimal tracking performance is influenced by
the non-minimum phase zeros, unstable poles, gain at all frequencies of the
given plant, and the reference input signal for NCSs. Moreover, the performance
limitation is also affected by the limited bandwidth, additive colored Gaussian
noise, and the corresponding multiples for the non-minimum phase zeros and
unstable poles. Additionally, the channel minimal input power constraints are
given under the condition ensuring the stability of the system and acquiring
system performance limitation. Finally, simulation examples are given to
illustrate the theoretical results.

  This paper studies optimal tracking performance issues for
multi-input-multi-output linear time-invariant systems under networked control
with limited bandwidth and additive colored white Gaussian noise channel. The
tracking performance is measured by control input energy and the energy of the
error signal between the output of the system and the reference signal with
respect to a Brownian motion random process. This paper focuses on two kinds of
network parameters, the basic network parameter-bandwidth and the additive
colored white Gaussian noise, and studies the tracking performance limitation
problem. The best attainable tracking performance is obtained, and the impact
of limited bandwidth and additive colored white Gaussian noise of the
communication channel on the attainable tracking performance is revealed. It is
shown that the optimal tracking performance depends on nonminimum phase zeros,
gain at all frequencies and their directions unitary vector of the given plant,
as well as the limited bandwidth and additive colored white Gaussian noise of
the communication channel. The simulation results are finally given to
illustrate the theoretical results.

Title: Learning what matters - Sampling interesting patterns
Authors: Vladimir Dzyuba, Matthijs van Leeuwen
Categories: stat.ML cs.AI cs.DB
Comments: PAKDD 2017, extended version
\\
  In the field of exploratory data mining, local structure in data can be
described by patterns and discovered by mining algorithms. Although many
solutions have been proposed to address the redundancy problems in pattern
mining, most of them either provide succinct pattern sets or take the interests
of the user into account-but not both. Consequently, the analyst has to invest
substantial effort in identifying those patterns that are relevant to her
specific interests and goals. To address this problem, we propose a novel
approach that combines pattern sampling with interactive data mining. In
particular, we introduce the LetSIP algorithm, which builds upon recent
advances in 1) weighted sampling in SAT and 2) learning to rank in interactive
pattern mining. Specifically, it exploits user feedback to directly learn the
parameters of the sampling distribution that represents the user's interests.
We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to the state-of-the-art in
interactive pattern mining by emulating the interests of a user. The resulting
system allows efficient and interleaved learning and sampling, thus
user-specific anytime data exploration. Finally, LetSIP demonstrates favourable
trade-offs concerning both quality-diversity and exploitation-exploration when
compared to existing methods.

Title: Representations of language in a model of visually grounded speech
  signal
Authors: Grzegorz Chrupa{\l}a, Lieke Gelderloos, Afra Alishahi
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  We present a visually grounded model of speech perception which projects
spoken utterances and images to a joint semantic space. We use a multi-layer
recurrent highway network to model the temporal nature of spoken speech, and
show that it learns to extract both form and meaning-based linguistic knowledge
from the input signal. We carry out an in-depth analysis of the representations
used by different components of the trained model and show that encoding of
semantic aspects tends to become richer as we go up the hierarchy of layers,
whereas encoding of form-related aspects of the language input tends to
initially increase and then plateau or decrease.

Title: Low Rank Matrix Recovery with Simultaneous Presence of Outliers and
  Sparse Corruption
Authors: Mostafa Rahmani, George Atia
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We study a data model in which the data matrix D can be expressed as D = L +
S + C, where L is a low rank matrix, S an element-wise sparse matrix and C a
matrix whose non-zero columns are outlying data points. To date, robust PCA
algorithms have solely considered models with either S or C, but not both. As
such, existing algorithms cannot account for simultaneous element-wise and
column-wise corruptions. In this paper, a new robust PCA algorithm that is
robust to simultaneous types of corruption is proposed. Our approach hinges on
the sparse approximation of a sparsely corrupted column so that the sparse
expansion of a column with respect to the other data points is used to
distinguish a sparsely corrupted inlier column from an outlying data point. We
also develop a randomized design which provides a scalable implementation of
the proposed approach. The core idea of sparse approximation is analyzed
analytically where we show that the underlying ell_1-norm minimization can
obtain the representation of an inlier in presence of sparse corruptions.

Title: A Region Based Easy Path Wavelet Transform For Sparse Image
  Representation

  The Easy Path Wavelet Transform is an adaptive transform for bivariate
functions (in particular natural images) which has been proposed in [1]. It
provides a sparse representation by finding a path in the domain of the
function leveraging the local correlations of the function values. It then
applies a one dimensional wavelet transform to the obtained vector, decimates
the points and iterates the procedure. The main drawback of such method is the
need to store, for each level of the transform, the path which vectorizes the
two dimensional data. Here we propose a variation on the method which consists
of firstly applying a segmentation procedure to the function domain,
partitioning it into regions where the variation in the function values is low;
in a second step, inside each such region, a path is found in some
deterministic way, i.e. not data-dependent. This circumvents the need to store
the paths at each level, while still obtaining good quality lossy compression.
This method is particularly well suited to encode a Region of Interest in the
image with different quality than the rest of the image.

  The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is the key step in many image and video
coding standards. The 8-point DCT is an important special case, possessing
several low-complexity approximations widely investigated. However, 16-point
DCT transform has energy compaction advantages. In this sense, this paper
presents a new 16-point DCT approximation with null multiplicative complexity.
The proposed transform matrix is orthogonal and contains only zeros and ones.
The proposed transform outperforms the well-know Walsh-Hadamard transform and
the current state-of-the-art 16-point approximation. A fast algorithm for the
proposed transform is also introduced. This fast algorithm is experimentally
validated using hardware implementations that are physically realized and
verified on a 40 nm CMOS Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T FPGA chip for a maximum
clock rate of 342 MHz. Rapid prototypes on FPGA for 8-bit input word size shows
significant improvement in compressed image quality by up to 1-2 dB at the cost
of only eight adders compared to the state-of-art 16-point DCT approximation
algorithm in the literature [S. Bouguezel, M. O. Ahmad, and M. N. S. Swamy. A
novel transform for image compression. In {\em Proceedings of the 53rd IEEE
International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)}, 2010].

  We run a selection of algorithms on two state-of-the-art 5-qubit quantum
computers that are based on different technology platforms. One is a publicly
accessible superconducting transmon device with limited connectivity, and the
other is a fully connected trapped-ion system. Even though the two systems have
different native quantum interactions, both can be programmed in a way that is
blind to the underlying hardware, thus allowing the first comparison of
identical quantum algorithms between different physical systems. We show that
quantum algorithms and circuits that employ more connectivity clearly benefit
from a better connected system of qubits. While the quantum systems here are
not yet large enough to eclipse classical computers, this experiment exposes
critical factors of scaling quantum computers, such as qubit connectivity and
gate expressivity. In addition, the results suggest that co-designing
particular quantum applications with the hardware itself will be paramount in
successfully using quantum computers in the future.

Title: Rare Nash Equilibria and the Price of Anarchy in Large Static Games
Authors: Daniel Lacker and Kavita Ramanan
Categories: math.PR cs.GT math.OC
\\
  We study a static game played by a finite number of agents, in which agents
are assigned independent and identically distributed random types and each
agent minimizes its objective function by choosing from a set of admissible
actions that depends on its type. The game is anonymous in the sense that the
objective function of each agent depends on the actions of other agents only
through the empirical distribution of their type-action pairs. We study the
asymptotic behavior of Nash equilibria, as the number of agents tends to
infinity, first by deriving laws of large numbers characterizes almost sure
limit points of Nash equilibria in terms of so-called Cournot-Nash equilibria
of an associated nonatomic game. Our main results are large deviation
principles that characterize the probability of rare Nash equilibria and
associated conditional limit theorems describing the behavior of equilibria
conditioned on a rare event. The results cover situations when neither the
finite-player game nor the associated nonatomic game has a unique equilibrium.
In addition, we study the asymptotic behavior of the price of anarchy,
complementing existing worst-case bounds with new probabilistic bounds in the
context of congestion games, which are used to model traffic routing in
networks.
